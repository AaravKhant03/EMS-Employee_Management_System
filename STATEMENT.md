## Project Title
Employee Management System (CLI-Based)

## Problem Statement
Organizations require a reliable and secure way to maintain employee information such as personal details, salary structure, and performance records. Manual record keeping leads to data inconsistency, loss of information, errors in salary updates, and delays in performance evaluation.  
There is a need for a centralized digital system that ensures authenticated access, accurate record management, and easy retrieval of employee data.

## Scope of the Project
This project focuses on:
- Secure login and authentication for accessing employee data
- Managing employee database including add/view/update operations
- Storing and retrieving performance review records
- Handling data integrity with proper validations
- Providing administrative reporting capabilities such as employee count
- Supporting real-time interaction through a command-line interface

The scope currently excludes:
- Multi-level role management (Admin/HR/Employee)
- Data export functionalities (PDF/CSV)
- Graphical or online access interface
- Predictive analytics and automation

## Target Users
This system is intended for:
- Human Resource personnel
- Internal administrative staff
- Small to medium-sized organizations needing a digital employee record system
- Educational purposes for demonstrating CRUD and authentication system design

## High-Level Features
- User registration and secure login using SHA-256 password hashing
- Add new employee records with mandatory validation
- Display stored employee data in a formatted layout
- Modify employee salary based on percentage increments
- Maintain employee performance reviews for evaluation
- Count total employees stored in the system
